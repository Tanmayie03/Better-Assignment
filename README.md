   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Run project:
   ```bash

## Design Choices Made

1. Responsive Design
   CSS Frameworks: Utilized TailwindCSS for rapid styling and consistency across components.
2. User Experience
   Validation: Integrated Formik with Yup for schema-based form validation for instant feedback.
   Password Strength Indicator enhanced the sign-up process by providing a visual password strength meter.

## Assumptions and Limitations

1. Assumptions
   The application assumes that the user inputs valid email and password formats as required.

2. Backend Integration:
   Currently, thereâ€™s no backend system thus the application displays alerts for successful actions but does not stores user data.
